##TEsting Log for Under the Maple TRee 02.02.2016

Skytimer Notes:

1. Saves automatically, without prompt. UPon restart, game loads automatically from savestate without prompt. So My first edit for Spookybean will be to find a way to insert a prompt at the beginning which offers the option of savegame management.
  a. Initial Menu
      IF no savedata exists:
          "    A. Start New Game
                  
          "
      IF savedata exists:
          "
              A. Start New Game
              B. Load Game
                .... Display Saved Games List.
                
                
  b. THroughout Game
      
      Define a Function to Go Save/Load Menu.
      
  
  C. On exit:
      Would you like to Save your Game? (y/n)
        Display Saved Games List
        a. Type name of Saved Game to Save Under, or Enter NEw Name (You may only have 5 savegames)
          current_save_name = raw_input("Type name of...")
          for i in savedgamenames:
            if current_save_name == i:
              print "saved Game as %s" % (current_save_name)
              !!Save the GameState in current_save_name.dat
            elif current_save_name !=
