If you are a tester, please enter any notes you have for me in the 
TESTING document, if you could.

GAME MANUAL:
(Noting basic instruction for gameplay.)
1. To equip and buy items, or view your inventory, visit a bartender 
at a local pub.  The equipping system is a part of the bartering
mechanic.  When you buy an item, it will be equipped for you.
You will sell your previous equipment, and it will be replaced with
your new item.  As the item system is sincerely a very linear 
progression of slight skill improvements, when you buy an item,
your old item will become obsolete.  If you already own the item,
you will be notified upon purchase, the item will be equipped and 
the transaction will cancel.  

2. If you choose to play as a mage: do not type out full spell
names in combat!  It is the way the spell system was designed.
For example, if you have 'fireball' as an available spell, you
only have to type 'f' to select it.  If you have two spells with 
the same name, i.e. 'fireball' and 'firestorm', you will be prompted
to specify further than just 'f', e.g. 'fires' for 'firestorm'.e
THIS CONCEPT IS ALSO APPLIED WHEN BARTERING WITH THE BARTENDER!!
So don't waste your time spelling out full item and spell names
when you don't have to!

3. As you level up, different enemies and areas open up, and the
story will progress! There is an assortment of dialogue, items, 
and settings to explore.  There's a little more to the game than 
repeated combat!  

4. Remember to have fun!  This game is not supposed to be overly
intricate or hard.  It was built out of love for the text based 
role-playing games I played as a child, and the desire to 
improve my skills in Python programming.  Thank you so much for
playing!
